# Real-Time Data Processing with System Monitoring

This Python project simulates real-time data processing while monitoring system resource usage, displaying live performance charts, and securely encrypting the final result. It is ideal for learning how to automate data workflows with a focus on performance and security.

## Features

- Simulated data processing in chunks.
- Real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage.
- Live visualization using `matplotlib` with smooth updates.
- Secure encryption of the processed result using `cryptography`.
- Modular architecture with classes and functions for reusability.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. The required packages are:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- psutil  
- cryptography  

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
